## **Dataset Information**

The dataset used in this project is the [Black Friday Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday). It contains anonymized information about customer purchases during Black Friday sales. 

### **Features:**
- **User_ID**: Unique ID for each customer.  
- **Product_ID**: Unique ID for each product.  
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (M/F).  
- **Age**: Age group of the customer.  
- **Occupation**: Occupation category of the customer.  
- **City_Category**: City tier (A/B/C).  
- **Stay_In_Current_City_Years**: Years of residence in the current city.  
- **Marital_Status**: Marital status of the customer.  
- **Product_Category_1-3**: Product category IDs.  
- **Purchase**: Amount spent by the customer.
